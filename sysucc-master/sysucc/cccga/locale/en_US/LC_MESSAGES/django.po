"Colorectal cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal "
"tract. At present, colorectal cancer ranks the third in the incidence of "
"malignant tumors in China and shows an increasing trend in recent years. "
"Genomic landscape of Chinese colorectal cancer is the largest cancer genome "
"study in China at present. We collected 1015 samples with paired samples and "
"500 cfDNA samples. The clinical information is relatively comprehensive, and "
"the genomic characteristics of the Chinese population are displayed "
"comprehensively, providing rich resources for deepening the understanding of "
"Chinese colorectal cancer."
